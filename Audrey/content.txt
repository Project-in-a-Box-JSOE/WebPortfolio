Audrey Olson
Software Engineer


[ABOUT]
My name is Audrey, and I'm an avid lover and aspiring implementer of innovative UI/UX design with a comparable zeal for music, filmography, and the written word. My perpetual goal as a software engineer (and onlooker into the curio cabinet of life) is the transparentization of any and all black boxes, technical or otherwise.
